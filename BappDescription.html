<p>
    Burp to Discord automatically forwards all issues to a Discord webhook as they are detected. This extension
    listens for issues from any source and delivers real-time notifications to Discord channels.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Real-time Discord notifications for all reported issues</li>
    <li>Configurable user mentions with Discord user ID integration</li>
    <li>Smart truncation of oversized requests and responses to stay within Discord's message limits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Navigate to "Settings &rarr; Extensions &rarr; Burp to Discord"</li>
    <li>Create a Discord webhook: right-click your channel, select "Edit Channel &rarr; Integrations &rarr; Webhooks", and
        copy the webhook URL</li>
    <li>Paste the webhook URL into the "Discord Webhook URL" field</li>
    <li>Optional: Enable user mentions by providing your Discord User ID (enable Developer Mode in Discord, then copy
        your user ID from your profile)</li>
    <li>Configure whether to include request/response data in notifications</li>
</ol>

<p>
    When an issue is detected, you'll receive a Discord notification containing the issue title, affected URL,
    and details. If request/response inclusion is enabled, the extension will send the HTTP traffic in follow-up
    messages, automatically truncating large payloads to prevent delivery failures.
